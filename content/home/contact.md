For teaching matters, you can contact me via [Canvas](https://canvas.uva.nl). 


If you have questions about joining my group or AMLab, check this [list](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/joining/) first.

If you are a Master in AI student at the University of Amsterdam and are interested in causality, feel free to contact me for potential thesis topics. As a rule, I also don't supervise Bachelor or Master students from other universities.

Currently I don't have any open vacancy for research assistants, PhD students or postdocs, but if I do, they will be announced on the [UvA vacancies website](https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/search/?createNewAlert=false&q=&optionsFacetsDD_department=&optionsFacetsDD_shifttype=Promotieplaats&optionsFacetsDD_facility=Faculteit+der+Natuurw.%2C+Wiskunde+%26+Informatica).

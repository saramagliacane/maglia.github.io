- August 2023: I helped organize [UAI 2023](https://www.auai.org/uai2023/) as online chair. We also organized a [Causality in time series workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ci4ts2023/home).

- July 2023: I gave an invited talk in the [Second Workshop on Spurious Correlations](https://icml.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/21493) at ICML.  

- July 2023: I gave an invited talk on Causality-inspired ML at the [European Meeting of Statisticians](https://ems2023.org/ems) in Warsaw. Pierogi <3

- June 2023: I gave a talk on [Causal vs Causality-inspired representation learning](https://mpml.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/seminars?id=7007) at the IST seminar series Mathematics, Physics & Machine Learning on Thursday June 8. 

- June 2023: I gave a lecture at the [SIKS causal inference course](https://siks.nl/activities/activities/siks-course-on-causal-inference/) on [constraint-based causal discovery](https://siks.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/670/2023/05/SIKS_constraint_based_causal_discovery.pdf).

- **Applications closed**: We had an opening for a PhD student in [Causality-inspired ML for robust fraud prediction](https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/job/Seven-PhD-positions-in-AI-for-Fintech/768660802/) with [dr. Ana Mićković](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/m/i/a.mickovic/a.mickovic.html) in the context of a large AI 4 Fintech project at the University of Amsterdam. Deadline: 21 May 2023

- 5 May 2023: I'm giving a keynote (virtually) at the ICLR 2023 workshop [Time Series Representation Learning in Health](https://sites.google.com/view/tsrl4h-iclr2023)

- 11-14 April 2023: I'm in the organization team of CLeaR 2023, you can see what's going on here on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CLeaR_2022) 

- 28 March 2023: I participated in an "Interdisciplinary Perspectives on AI & Culture" event on [Prediction and causality](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/interdisciplinary-perspectives-on-ai-culture-2-prediction-causality-tickets-547750104307) with historian Melvin Wevers.

- 20 March 2023: I gave a talk on causality and distribution shifts at the 1st joint webinar of the IMS New Researchers Group, Young Data Science Researcher Seminar Zürich and the YoungStatS Project. Check the [video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/live/XQ-Udp_WaMM?feature=share&t=2382) and also check the previous talk by Zijian Guo and the discussion by Niklas Pfister.

- 15 March 2023: I gave a keynote at [Yes Causal Inference](https://www.eurandom.tue.nl/event/yes-causal-inference/#Programme_and_Talks) in Eidhoven.

- February 2023: I gave two lectures on causal discovery and causality-inspired ML at the Barcelona School of Economics at the [ML and causality course](https://events.bse.eu/live/files/3518-21d007-machine-learning-and-causal-inferenceokpdf) in the Data Science Master.

- January 2023: I was one of the four speakers (with Guido Imbens, Kathrin Schultz and Thomas Icard) at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) event on [Causality in economics, computer science, logic, and language](https://www.knaw.nl/en/events/causality-economics-computer-science-logic-and-language). This is the second time I gave a talk after Guido Imbens, and talking in a session with a Nobel Laureate is still as nerve-wracking as the first time.

- January 2023: I gave a talk on Causality and robustness to distribution shifts at the [Bellairs Workshop on Causality](https://aldro61.github.io/bcl2023/)


- November 2022: I gave a keynote on causality-inspired ML at [Danish Data Science 2022](https://ddsa.dk/keynotespeakers/) on November 8, here are the [slides](https://saramagliacane.github.io/slides/DanishDataScience2022_magliacane.pdf).

- November-December 2022: Busy months: I'm an area chair for [CLeaR 2023](https://www.cclear.cc/2023), a meta-reviewer for [AAAI 2023](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-23/), helping organize [CLeaR 2023](https://www.cclear.cc/2023), [UAI 2023](https://www.auai.org/uai2022/) and the NeurIPS workshop ["A causal view on dynamical systems"](https://sites.google.com/view/caudyn2022).
